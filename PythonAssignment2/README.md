Python List Operations

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python, including
appending elements, inserting at a specific position,
extending with another list, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value.

Features

- Initialize an empty list
- Append multiple values at once
- Insert an element at a specific index
- Extend the list with additional values
- Remove the last element
- Sort the list in ascending order
- Find and print the index of a given value

Code Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. Creates an empty list.
2. Adds values `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
3. Inserts `15` at the second position.
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element (`70`).
6. Sorts the list.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.

Sample Output

bash
3

This indicates that `30` is at index 3 in the sorted list.

Requirements

- Python 3

Usage

Run the script in any Python environment:

bash
python lists.py
